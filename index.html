    <p>Hello, my name is Jay and I am from somewhere
      Hi there! I'm Joseph Jacob, a passionate tech enthusiast based in Nairobi, Kenya. I hold a Diploma in Computer Science from St. Paul's University, where I developed a strong foundation in computing.

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I've had the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in various domains, teaching, working with children, I.T technician.

My journey in the tech industry has been fueled by my curiosity to explore new technologies and my desire to create solutions that make a positive impact on people's lives. I am constantly learning and adapting to the ever-evolving landscape of technology.

Outside of my professional endeavors, I am actively involved in volunteering activities, serving my community through initiatives. Giving back to society is a core value that drives me, and I believe in using my skills and knowledge to contribute to meaningful causes.

My mission is to leverage technology as a catalyst for positive change, whether it's through building innovative solutions, collaborating with aspiring developers, or with like-minded individuals to tackle societal challenges.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to connecting with you!
